# Wireshark Capture Summary

This file provides a quick overview of Wireshark captures included in this repository.

| Capture File       | Filter Applied         | Observations                                                      |
|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| capture1.png       | None (Overall Capture) | Full network traffic captured. Includes TCP, UDP, ICMP, and other protocols. |
| capture2.png       | TCP                    | Captured only TCP traffic. Shows active TCP connections, SYN/ACK handshakes, and ongoing sessions. |
| capture3.png       | UDP                    | Captured only UDP traffic. Includes DNS queries and other UDP-based communications. |

## Notes

- TCP traffic shows connection-oriented communication (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK sequences).  
- UDP traffic shows connectionless communication, including DNS requests and responses.  
- These captures were performed for educational purposes only on authorized networks.
